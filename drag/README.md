# Drag

This project was motivated by [this picture](https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/dwayne-the-rock-johnson-skyscraper-jump-funny-reactions-1-5a7ab25b4d416__700.jpg) of "The Rock" jumping between skyscrapers. We start with a rather rudimentary simulation of how objects fly through space and then try to make it progressively more realistic.
