# code_projects

This is repo to collect some  of the small projects I did over the last couple of months. Most of them are a particular solution to a physics problem that is either well known or popped up during my daily life. 

Currently we have:
 - **Butter Problem**: does a toast fall on the butter side or not?
 - **n-Body**: a n-body simulation written in C++ and animation done in Python
