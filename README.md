# code_projects

This is repo to collect some  of the small projects I did over the last couple of months. Most of them are a particular solution to a physics problem that is either well known or popped up during my daily life. 

Currently we have:
 - **Butter Problem**: does a toast fall on the butter side or not? A simulation written in the Wolfram Language (Mathematica) to determine if a piece of bread will land on the butter side or not. The final result is a a graph, tabel-height vs. initial-bread-speed, showing in which cases we have a good start into the day.
 - **n-Body**: a n-body simulation written in C++ and animation done in Python. The animation generated shows the evolution of the Solar System from some day in Sep. 1994 for approximately 500 years into the future. Also, a short analysis on the implemented ODE solvers is present.
