# Penna

The following code is the result of a series of exercises from a class at ETH. The goal was to reproduce the results from Penna's paper, ["A bit-string model for biological aging"](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02180147), with efficiently written C++ code. 

### What was emphasized:
 - How to approach implementing an algorithm when one only has a paper as reference. 
 - Besides the standard discussion when and how to use classes to represent abstract types, we also talked about inheritance and when vs. when-not to use it. 
 - Which container to choose depending on the problem, i.e. do we need fast random-access or do we just need to get one element after the other, etc. See that it can even make sense to add some functionaly to an already existing container, as long as one is careful. 
 - How to use the C++'s `algorithm`-library and what the advanteges of it are. 
 - How to incorporate tests into ones project. 

### What still needs to be done:
 - Documentation
